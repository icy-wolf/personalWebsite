          <h3>Lakeview High School</h3>
          <p>During my highschool career I went to two different high schools. Lakeview High School was my home high school and the ciriculum focused on english, history, physical education etc. I was a member of the National Honors Society and I would volunteer to be a part of the student run Read-to-Lead program where I would encourage 3rd-5th graders to read. </p>

          <h3>Battle Creek Area Math and Science Center</h3>
          <p>The BCAMSC was the second high school I attended. The ciriculum was focused on math, science, engineering and technology courses. I was a member on our VEX robotics team as a builder and driver attending two competitions during my senior year. I was also a member on the student advisory board to help plan our annual lock-in.</p>
