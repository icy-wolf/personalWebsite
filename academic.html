          <p>During my high school career I attended two different high schools. Lakeview High School was my home high school and the ciriculum focused on english, history, physical education etc. I was a member of the National Honors Society and I volunteered to be a part of a student run "Read-to-Lead" program to encourage 3rd-5th graders to read.</p>
